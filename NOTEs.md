::: Base Architecture :::
Flutter app: UI and client-side logic
Springboot API: server-side logic and database access
OpenStreetMap's Nominatim API: geolocation API for calculating distance between users
Google AdMob: advertising SDK for displaying ads in the app

::: Development process :::
1. Plan out the user experience and user interface for the app. This will involve wireframing and prototyping the various screens and features that the app will have, such as user profiles, messaging, and ad displays.
2. Set up the server-side component using Springboot API. This will involve creating a RESTful API that the Flutter app can communicate with to perform actions such as registering new users, logging in, and querying the database for matches.
3. Set up the geolocation feature using OpenStreetMap's Nominatim API. This will involve integrating the API with the Springboot API to retrieve latitude and longitude coordinates from user addresses and calculate the distance between users.
4. Set up the database schema and models for user profiles, messages, and ads. This will involve defining the fields for each model and configuring the database to store the data.
5. Implement the advertising feature using Google AdMob. This will involve integrating the AdMob SDK with the Flutter app to display ads in various formats such as banner ads, interstitial ads, and rewarded ads.
6. Develop the Flutter app UI and client-side logic. This will involve building out the screens and features wireframed in step 1, and communicating with the Springboot API to perform actions such as registering new users, logging in, and querying the database for matches.
7. Test the app and deploy to the app store. This will involve thorough testing to ensure that all features are functioning properly, and submitting the app to the app store for publication.
